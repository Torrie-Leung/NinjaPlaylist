    <p>You stagger home every evening after working overtime again. In a comalike state, you force yourself to eat dinner while -in total silence- you think horrible thoughts about your boss. After that, you vegetate for hours in front of the TV and are bombarded with news about murders, acts of terrorism, corrupt politicians, and doomsday prophecies about our climate. You're so stressed and tense that if feels like it's impossible to do anything else.</p>
    <p>If you see somebody who needs some help at work, something that you could do in five minutes, but you choose to look the other way because it isn't actually your job, then that's your responsibility. Your decision to be a less-helpful colleague will always be your responsibility. You will discover the consequnce of that choice the day you're the one who needs help.</p>
